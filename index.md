## About
I am a Postdoctoral Researcher working on reliable and interpretable AI for decision support, with a focus on reinforcement learning (RL), optimization, and statistical inference.  
My research develops **risk-sensitive and variance-aware RL** methods (e.g., empirical variance penalization, sample-averaged Q-learning with asymptotic inference) and applies them to complex resource allocation and sequential decision-making problems.

**Research interests:** Reinforcement Learning • Risk-sensitive RL • Statistical Inference • Optimization • Sequential Decision-Making • Human-centered AI
